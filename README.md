> Entropy fighting mathematactic game

A survival puzzle game, begins with a 100 energy point reserve. Each move, which involves increasing a card's value by one, drains 10 points from this reserve.

Adjacent cards of identical value merge into a cluster. When a card's value matches the cluster's size, the cluster is destroyed, replenishing your energy according to the card's value. The game concludes when you deplete your energy reserve.

Features a decentralized leaderboard, allowing you to immortalize your username without the need for registration. Digifall's open source code provides transparency into its mechanics and encourages community contributions to its evolution.
